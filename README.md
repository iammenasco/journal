I couldn't tell you how to install this. Its been a long time. Its pretty worthless now-a-days.

This was for a project in college. I really enjoyed working on this project, but its pretty dead.

I am glad you asked. Currently (Oct, 2016) working on a Electron Journaling App, which deploys to macOS as well as Heroku.

Check it out in my other repos.
